    "We will take the role of a private investor that has decided to purchase a property in Spain for renting it out through Airbnb. After careful examination, we have selected 9 possible Spanish cities where it would be interesting to make such a purchase. Naturally, we want to maximize our return on investment (ROI), for which we need to understand the competition in each city as well as the main price drivers for each location.\n",

    "1. _**What is the average price of each location type per neighbourhood? What are the most expensive neighbourhoods on average?**_\n",
    "2. _**What is the average host acceptance rate per location type and neighborhood? In which neighbourhoods is it the lowest?**_\n",
    "3. _**How is the competition in each neighbourhood? What number and proportion of listings belong to hosts owning different numbers of locations? In which neighbourhoods is the concentration lower?**_\n",
    "4. _**What is the expected average profit per room type and neighborhood when looking at the reservations for the next 6 months? What is the neighbourhood expected to be the most profitable in that period?**_\n",
    "5. _**What listings' factors affect the expected profit for the next 6 months? Can we use them to forecast the expected profit over that period?**_\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be comparing the answers to those questions among the different Spanish regions of **Madrid**, **Barcelona**, **Girona**, **Valencia**, **Mallorca**, **Menorca**, **Sevilla**, **MÃ¡laga** and **Euskadi**. Hopefully, this will help us in making a more informed investment decision.\n"

LightGBM is a gradient boosting ensemble machine learning algorithm that is known for achieving great predictive results while being very computationally efficient. In each fold, we train a [LGBMRegressor](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pythonapi/lightgbm.LGBMRegressor.html) model and measure performance using [R2 score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html).
